What is fate of Jeff? Fate of Jeff is a PowerShell text/story based game. To play it simply run Powershell ISE as admin, copy and paste the text into the script area, and run it. Dont worry, the program is completly safe.

You will find that game is very bad and buggy, its made with powershell, which I barley know how to use.
